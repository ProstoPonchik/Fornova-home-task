# Hotel Price Analysis

## Description
This Python script processes hotel pricing data to:
1. Find the cheapest room price (without using the `min()` function).
2. Return the room type and number of guests for the cheapest room.
3. Calculate and display the total price (net price + taxes) for all room types.
4. Save the output to a JSON file.

## Usage
1. Place the `Python-task.json` file in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
